# v0.7 changelog
* New feature to limit reads to N reads (`--downsample`) in case of samples with extremely high depth.
* Updated Qiime2 to 2023.2 version (This should not affect downstream results) to get rid of
annoying installation issue with old Qiime2 version.

# v0.5 changelog
* Allow splitting samples into group for dada2 noise (pool column in metadata TSV, see
  GitHub documentation [here](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pb-16S-nf#pooling)).
* #22: Added `--publish_dir_mode` to allow users to specify if they want the outputs in
  other modes such as hardcopy instead of the default Nextflow behaviour (absolute symlinks).
* Handle a minor bug in `visualize_biom.Rmd` script whereby if the samples are extremely
  similar to each other, MDS plotting will fail.
* Cleaned up code with small changes to allow pipeline to run on AWS. Big thanks to
  collaborator from AGRF Australia for initiating, testing and providing feedbacks.

# v0.4 changelog
* Fix some bugs wrongly displaying Naive-Bayes statistics as VSEARCH stats in HTML
* Allow manually specifying primers with `--forward_p` and `--adapter_p` for
  `cutadapt`
* Allow skipping Naive-Bayes classification via the `--skip_nb` parameter. This
  allows user to easily use any database with VSEARCH and generate report. See FAQ.
* Fixed bug preventing single sample heatmap from displaying
* Save versions and parameters in `parameters.txt` for reproducibility
* Updated QIIME 2 environment YAML.
* Fixed issue 17 reported by Stephane. Nextflow and Mamba do not need to be installed
  at base conda environment.

# v0.3 changelog
* Updated naive classifier approach to use GTDB r207 (updated from r202) and make GTDB r207 the first priority so it's more consistent with VSEARCH-based classification. I.e. in the naive classification approach, ASVs are classified firstly by GTDB before Silva and RefSeq (In v0.2, Silva was the first priority).
* New feature: Optional  `PICRUSt2` for pathway inference.
* Databases are now downloaded from a central Zenodo DOI to make process more robust: https://zenodo.org/record/6912512 

# v0.2 changelog
* Starts tracking version, no main changes compared to previous version except that the pipeline is now versioned.
